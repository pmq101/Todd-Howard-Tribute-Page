        <h2 class="text-center">Career Facts</h2>
        <ul class="tab">
          <li>Born in April 25, 1971.</li>
          <li>Graduated from College of William & Mary in 1993 with degrees in engineering and finance.</li>
          <li>However, Todd Howard had always maintained an interest in developing video games.</li>
          <li>During college, after playing <i>Wayne Gretzky Hockey</i> by Bethesda Softworks, Mr. Howard realized that a Bethesda Softworks office was located on the very same path he took to and from school.</li>
          <li>He sought a job at the Bethesda Softworks office during his time at college but was rejected on the basis of being a college undergraduate. He applied a second time after completing college but was rejected yet again (amusing in retrospect, considering
            that today's Todd Howard is one of Bethesda Softworks' most iconic figures).</li>
          <li>He did not give up and managed to join the Bethesda Softworks company by 1994.</li>
          <li>Mr. Howard initially served as a designer for titles such as <i>The Terminator: Future Shock</i> (1995) and <i></i>The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall</li> (1996).
          <li>Todd Howard soon took on a more executive role as project leader and designer of the title <i>The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind</i> (1998). He would later lead and develop <i>The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion</i> (2006), <i>Fallout 3</i> (2008), <i>The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim</i>      (2011), and <i>Fallout 4</i> (2015), with each of the four titles winning the acclaimed Game of the Year award.</li>
          <li>Mr. Howard also speaks at large events such as the D.I.C.E. Summit and Bethesda E3 showcases.</li>
          <li>In 2012, Todd Howard was nominated as "Best Game Director" by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences.</li>
          <li>Todd Howard continues to lead and develop video games for Bethesda Softworks to this day. However, his story provides an excellent source of inspiration for any individual wishing to pursue their passions.</li>
